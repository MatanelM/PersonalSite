          A small game developed with HTML, JS, and CSS.  It is fully responsive, and can be played in a touch screen. 
          The platform for this game is Angular4. I deployed The game and you can click <a  href="https://matanelm93.github.io/MineSweeper/">here</a>
           if you want to try it out. The game is available in 3 modes - easy, medium, and difficult. The game rendering made simple by using CSS grid, 
           which is awesome! if you are new to CSS, you've got to give it a shot. Enjoy the famous game from Windows 98!

          A system for selling coupons, developed with Java Spring, pgAdmin and Angular. 
          This project is part of Java Fullstack course, and I scored 95 for it. I deployed the project locally, 
          and you can clone the code from <a href="https://github.com/MatanelM93/CouponSystemProject">my git repo</a>.  
          This system has a log in panel, and after logging in you can sell / buy coupons. A company user can publish coupons, 
          and a customer user can purchase them. both of the users can see their coupons in their profile panel. 
          This project is like groupon, basically.

        <p>
          The current trend of healthy lifestyle is not a bad thing, right? Then why not developing an app for it? My diet calculator is a website that holds a user profile
          with his list of consumable items. He can then add a list of items which he can save to his profile as a meal. every meal has its total calories, carbs, fats and protein.
          So a user can have a list of meals that are healthy for him, and he can watch them from anywhere by logging in to his user.
          The project is <a  href="https://calculate-diet.herokuapp.com/">deployed</a>, but fortunantly heroku has removed the free MongoDB addon in recent updates. But, you can <a href="https://github.com/MatanelM93/Calculate_Diet">clone</a> the project from git and deploy it locally if you want to see 
          the project running. 
          This project was developed with Python flask, BeautifulSoup and Django, besides MongoDB as the database.

          I made an AI that receieves variables of an object in motion, and solve kinematics equations base on the given requested parameter. I connected this AI with an application
          that can get vectors components and then show them visually, show the vector resultant, and show the vectors in a cartesian form. I have deployed both and you can try and
          play with them online right now. <br><a href="https://physics-app-3c4c3.web.app/kinematics">Kinematics resolver</a><br><a href="https://physics-app-3c4c3.web.app/vectors">Graphic Vectors</a>
